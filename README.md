## Kaggle_House_Price_Prediction

I am sharing my code in analyzing kaggle house price dataset. I have attached three notebooks including EDA notebook, Hyperparameters Optimization notebook, and Model notebook. I think the names are self-descriptive. I have addressed the link to some great notebooks if I have used their methods or codes. I placed in top 10% in top 10% among 5,000 competetitors. 

### Install 

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains most of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Codes` folder.  

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Codes/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook {name of notebook file}.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
